  FirebirdWebAdmin is a web frontend for the Firebird database server.


  By now it has the functionalities for
  
  o creating, deleting, modifying databases, tables, generators,
    views, triggers, domains, indices, stored procedures, udf's,
    exceptions, roles and database users

  o performing sql expressions on databases and display the results

  o import and export of data through files in the csv format

  o browsing through the contents of tables and views, watching them
    growing while typing in data

  o selecting data for deleting and editing while browsing tables

  o inserting, deleting, displaying the contents of blob fields

  o diplaying database metadata, browsing the interbase system tables

  o database backup and restore, database maintenance


  Some of the features are only available if the database- and the
  web-server are running on the same machine. The reason is that php
  have to call the Firebird tools (isql, gsec, gstat, etc.) to
  perform certain actions.
